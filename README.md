**Effective Date: 21 July 2025**

Seeraty â€“ AI CV Builder ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## Information We Collect

### 1. Personal Data
We do **not require you to create an account** or provide personal details.  
However, we use **Firebase Anonymous Authentication** to generate a **non-identifiable, unique user ID** for analytics and crash reporting. No personal data (such as name, email, or photo) is collected.

---

### 2. Usage Data
We collect anonymized usage statistics and crash data through third-party services. This may include:
- Device type and operating system  
- App usage events (e.g., feature usage, screens viewed)  
- Crash logs and diagnostics
- User interactions with app features

---

### 3. CV Data
All CV-related data (including name, photo, work experience, etc.) is stored **locally on your device**.  
It is **never uploaded**, synced, or shared with any third party.

---

### 4. AI Processing Data
When you use our AI features (CV generation, ATS scoring, cover letter creation), your CV data is temporarily sent to Google's AI service for processing. This data is:
- Processed to generate your requested content
- Not permanently stored by Google's AI service
- Not used for any other purpose
- Protected by Google's privacy policies

---

### 5. App Permissions
- **Photo Library Access**: We request access to your photo library only when you choose to add a profile picture to your CV. We do not access, store, or transmit any photos beyond what you explicitly select.

---

### 6. Additional Local Data
We also store locally on your device:
- ATS scores and analysis results
- Cover letters and their content
- App settings and language preferences
- Error logs for debugging purposes

---

## Data Processing and AI Services

We use Google's AI service (Firebase AI/Gemini) to:
- Generate professional CV content
- Analyze CV compatibility with job descriptions (ATS scoring)
- Create personalized cover letters

Your CV data is sent to Google's servers only for these specific purposes and is not used for any other reason.

---

## Third-Party Services

We use the following tools to improve the app experience:

- **Firebase Analytics** â€“ for collecting anonymized app usage statistics  
- **Firebase Crashlytics** â€“ for capturing crash reports and diagnostics  
- **Firebase Authentication (Anonymous)** â€“ to assign a unique anonymous user ID for analytics and crash tracking purposes only
- **Google AI Service (Firebase AI/Gemini)** â€“ for processing CV data to generate content, ATS scores, and cover letters

These services may collect anonymized device data and event information as part of their standard functionality.

## Data Security

All sensitive data (like your CV content) remains on your device.  
We take reasonable measures to secure any analytics or diagnostics data transmitted by third-party services.

---

## Data Retention

- **Local Data**: All CV data, ATS scores, and cover letters remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the app
- **Analytics Data**: Firebase Analytics retains usage data according to Google's privacy policy
- **Crash Data**: Firebase Crashlytics retains crash reports for debugging purposes
- **AI Processing**: No CV data is permanently stored by Google's AI service

## Your Rights and Choices

If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data will be removed.  
You can also opt out of personalized ads in your device settings (Android) if applicable.

### Additional Choices:
- **AI Processing**: You can choose not to use AI features if you prefer not to send data for processing
